## Overview

Vile are female nature spirits from South Slavic folklore, characterized by their ethereal beauty, long flowing hair, and white garments. Some traditions hold they are spirits of unbaptized or unchaste women, while others view them as personifications of natural forces—embodiments of wind, clouds, mountains, and forests.

Possessing remarkable abilities including shape-shifting, healing, prophecy, and control over weather and animals, vile are fiercely protective of nature and can be helpful allies to those who treat them with respect. However, they are dangerously vengeful when wronged. Stealing their possessions (especially their belts, veils, or wings) or intruding on their dancing can result in terrible curses or death.

Their ring dances leave lasting marks on the earth—circular patterns where grass dies or burns, known as fairy rings. Dancing with a vila can lead to death from exhaustion, as mortals cannot match their supernatural endurance.
