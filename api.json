      "full": "Vile are female nature spirits from South Slavic folklore, characterized by their ethereal beauty, long flowing hair, and white garments. Some traditions hold they are spirits of unbaptized or unchaste women, while others view them as personifications of natural forces. Possessing abilities including shape-shifting, healing, prophecy, and control over weather and animals, vile are protective of nature and can be helpful allies to those who treat them with respect. However, they are dangerously vengeful when wronged, and stealing their possessions or intruding on their dancing can result in curses or death. Their ring dances leave marks on the earth where grass dies or burns."
